BugzillaMigrate
===============

bzmigrate.pl is a Perl program to parse the XML output of Bugzilla
(2.22 onward?) into structures suitable for programmatic upload to a new bug
tracker; initally targeting GitHub Issues (v3).

You can create an XML dump from Bugzilla by searching for the appropriate bugs,
and hitting the XML button at the bottom of the page - the output from which
will contain the full specification of all bugs shown.

The script currently expects the output of this dump to be saved in the current
directory (i.e. that which you are running the script from) by the name:
    bugzilla.xml
